# text-image-process
text preprocessing in english and farsi context. Image denoising.

/* A DEMONSTRATION DEMO */

of course you can take inputs from the user in main to select which function 
to get executed instead of commenting them out and etc. But this is for 
just a sample and developer use :)

PLEASE UNCOMMENT nltk.download() line in ./src/workers.py for the first time of 
execution. it would let the 'words' to get downloaded. :)

you can change the threshold of IMAGE DENOISING in .env file to get your desired reulst.
it is not perfect as it must be.
cnn denoising will be added the future for the proper result.

best regards!
HAPPY CODING! :)
