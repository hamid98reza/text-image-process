/* A DEMONSTRATION DEMO */

of course you can take inputs from the user in main to select which function 
to get executed instead of commenting them out and etc. But this is for 
just a sample and developer use :)

PLEASE UNCOMMENT nltk.download() line in ./src/workers.py for the first time of 
execution. it would let the 'words' to get downloaded. :)

HAPPY CODING :)
